	<h1>Welcome the Care Management System Page!</h1>
	<p class="type1">For my computer science course work I decided to produce a care management system that helps manage and keep track of carers and clients for an in-house elderly care agency.
					<br>I was inspired to do this after having spent a large portion of my summer working for a care agency where I had to use software that serve4d the same fundamentals as the one I decided to create. The experience was fun and allowed me to learn a lot more about programming and designing and breaking up big programs into smaller modules.</p>
	<p class = "type1">My course work can be broken down into five main features these are:</p>
	<ul class ="type1">
	<li>Carer Database</li>
	<li>Client Database</li>
	<li>Rota Builder</li>
	<li>Rota Viewer</li>
	<li>Finance Payroll Generator</li>
	</ul>
