	<h1>Welcome to the Battle Royale Dev Page!</h1>
	<p class="type1">Battle Royale is my attempt at a platform-based "smash" style video game! It is currently in very early stages and will probably never be finished!</p>
	<p class = "type1">The game allows you to take control of a ninja, which can run, jump, swing his sword and shoot arrows! Currently, two players can play the game against each other in a sandbox mode, where the blue ninja and the black ninja will fight. There is currently no way to win the game or beat your opponent, but that will hopefully be added in furture updates!</p>
